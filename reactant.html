                <p>In the 1950s and 1960s, women were confined to the home under the full control of men with societal
                    ideas of traditional gender roles
                    during this period heavily restricted what women could do. In
                    particular, it was overwhelmingly difficult for women to find jobs in male-dominated industries such
                    as the scientific field. Despite these constraints, many women began to challenge and question the
                    restrictive
                    norms, gradually working towards significant changes in society.</p><img class="object-fit-cover"

                                anyone remember a Mrs. George Fillis -- the woman who had the audacity to tell us she
                                wanted to become a heart surgeon? I have an update. It seems that Mrs. Fillis has not
                                only completed her premed studies in record time but has also been accepted to medical
                                school. Congratulations Mrs. George -- no, I’m sorry -- Marjorie Fillis. We never
                                doubted you for a second</span></p>

                <p>Although Elizabeth Zott was the public figure who encouraged women to take action to combat the
                    gender discrimination, the quote above shows that without the commitment and perseverance of the
                    women, change would have been impossible.
                    The above quote shows an example of a devoted woman who, with the influence of Elizabeth,
                    contradicting the preexisting ideas of gender roles to reach medical school.</p><img

                <p>The change that Elizabeth Zott helps bring about would not have been possible without the reactants
                    to the reaction, the women who took action with her influence.
                    These women refused to accept the status quo and, motivated by Elizabeth's popularity and
                    credibility, took action to make a difference.</p </div>
